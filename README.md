#InspectorSelector
I wrote this a while ago and decided to put it up here recently.  Its not perfect, or even really finished.  Completely untested. will probably crash trying to access an invalid MObject/MDagPath at some point. I'm working on other things now.

to Explain:
It's similar to XSI's isolate select. Except there is one UI to cntrl isolation for all viewpanes regardless of pane layout.  So the 'isolate' button will toggle on/off isolate selection for the viewpane btns below.  There are also memory btns to the right.  middle click to set one, left click to load that memory, and right click to clear.
